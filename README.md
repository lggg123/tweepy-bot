# tweepy-bot
Here we have a bot that I made for twitter that is can be run by:

Navigating to the Directory and typing in the terminal:

python3 twitter.py 

The bot should run with 'like' appearing in the terminal signifying it is liking the tweet based on the search 

and a couple of other bots that need more help to be able to work
